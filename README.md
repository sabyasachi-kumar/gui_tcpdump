# gui_tcpdump
This Python script creates a PyQt5-based graphical user
interface (GUI) for monitoring network traffic using the
tcpdump command-line tool. It offers features such as
interface selection, options configuration, packet capture,
and data export. The script consists of a `Window` class
with methods to handle UI components, capture and display
packets, and interact with the tcpdump command. The main
function initializes the application, configures a dark theme
(not currently implemented), and runs the GUI in an event
loop. This code provides a user-friendly interface for
network traffic analysis.
